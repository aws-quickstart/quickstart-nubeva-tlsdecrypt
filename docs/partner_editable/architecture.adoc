*default parameters* builds the following Nubeva network and security monitoring environment in the
AWS Cloud.

The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to
provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for each open-source tool, to provide scaling for the tool
operation itself and for inbound packet mirroring using Amazon VPC traffic mirrors or
internal replication.
* Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) for the open-source tools that require
Elasticsearch, Moloch, or for managing the logs from Zeek and Suricata.
* An Amazon S3 bucket for Moloch packet capture (PCAP) storage.
* Amazon VPC traffic mirroring targets connected to each open-source load balancer.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the subnets.*
** Bastion host for all inbound connectivity.*
* In the private subnets:
** A source instance in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2). This is a sample instance
you can use to monitor TLS traffic. After deployment, use the Nubeva SaaS
console to add more instances to monitor.
** The source instance has a container-based Nubeva TLS Decrypt agent deployed.
This agent listens through all available interfaces, discovers TLS session keys,
and, optionally, mirrors a copy of the packet stream to the open-source tools for
analysis.
** Moloch packet capture in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2).
** Ntop network analysis in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2).
** Suricata signature detection in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2).
** Wireshark packet analysis in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2).
** Zeek anomaly detection in an Auto Scaling group (of size 2).

the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
