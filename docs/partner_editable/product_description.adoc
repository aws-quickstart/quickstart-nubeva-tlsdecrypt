Nubeva’s SKI architecture provides a visibility solution that provides complete
packet visibility of any public cloud with TLS decryption capabilities. All the open-source
tools in this solution are complemented by Nubeva SKI sensors, which provides additional
intelligence and insight into encrypted data.

Container-based Nubeva SKI sensors are deployed on your monitored instances,
which capture TLS session keys as they flow through these instances. The
packets are sent using VPC traffic mirrors to be analyzed and visualized by the open-source
tools you choose. This provides clear visibility of your network traffic so you can identify
unexpected network behavior, perform network analysis, and detect intrusions.
