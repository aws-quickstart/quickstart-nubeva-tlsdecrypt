Nubevaâ€™s SKI architecture provides complete packet visibility of any public cloud with TLS decryption capabilities. All open-source tools in this solution are complemented by {partner-company-name} SKI sensors, which provide additional intelligence and insight into encrypted data.

Container-based {partner-company-name} SKI sensors are deployed on your monitored instances and capture TLS session keys as they flow through these instances. The
packets are sent using VPC traffic mirrors that are analyzed and visualized by your chosen open-source
tools. This flow provides clear visibility of your network traffic so you can identify
unexpected network behavior, perform network analysis, and detect intrusions.
