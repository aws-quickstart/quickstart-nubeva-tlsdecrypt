// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-company-name} SKI into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-company-name} SKI into this new VPC.
* *Deploy {partner-company-name} SKI into an existing VPC*. This option provisions Nubeva SKI in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-company-name} SKI settings, as discussed later in this guide.
