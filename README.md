## Nubeva TLS Decryp

This Quick Start deploys Nubeva TLS Decrypt on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 10 minutes. This Quick Start is for users who want to identify malicious activity, insider threats, and data leakage within their virtual private cloud (VPC) instances and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances with decrypted visibility.

Nubeva’s TLS visibility solution is a software as a service (SaaS) that provides complete packet visibility of any public cloud with TLS decryption capabilities. All the open-source tools in this solution are complemented by Nubeva TLS Decrypt, which provides additional intelligence and insight into encrypted data.

Container-based Nubeva TLS Decrypt sensors are deployed on your monitored instances, which capture TLS session keys—as well as associated packet traffic for any instance where Amazon VPC traffic mirroring isn’t available—as they flow through these instances. The packets are sent through a secure channel to be analyzed and visualized by the open-source tools you choose. This provides clear visibility of your network traffic so you can identify unexpected network behavior, perform network analysis, and detect intrusions.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy Nubeva TLS Decrypt in your AWS account.
